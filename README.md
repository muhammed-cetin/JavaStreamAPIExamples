<h1>Stream API</h1>
<p>The Java Stream API is an interface introduced in Java 8 and used for data manipulation and manipulation in collections, arrays and other data structures. The Stream API provides a powerful and declarative programming model, which contributes to making code more readable and maintainable.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The main features of the Java Stream API are :</h2>
<ul>
<li>Declarative Programming :
<ul>
<li>The Stream API allows you to describe (declare) how to perform operations, without having to specify step-by-step how to do it. This makes the code more clear and understandable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Functional Programming Paradigm :
<ul>
<li>Stream API supports the principles of functional programming. It makes it easier to write code using functional programming features in Java 8, such as lambda expressions and functional interfaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parallel Processing Support :
<ul>
<li>The Stream API provides the ability to easily parallelize processes. This can improve performance on multiprocessor systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Collection Operations :
<ul>
<li>API facilitates operations on collections (List, Set, Map, etc.). It can be used to perform common operations such as filtering, mapping, organizing, aggregating elements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mitigating Impacts :
<ul>
<li>Stream API refers to functions that perform operations on data. This keeps variable states to a minimum and reduces unwanted side effects.</li>
</ul>
